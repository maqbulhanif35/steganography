A program that hides files or folders in png files
Works only with Linux at the moment
       USAGE
  The first argument to the png program should be the png file always. eg ./png sample.png file1.txt file2.txt ...
  You can add a folder to the png file with the flag -f eg ./png sample.png folder -f
  You can add multiple files to the same png file but not multiple folders
  You can only add a folder to an empty png file
  You can extract the files or folders with "extract sample.png" this will extract all the 
     embedded files at the location of the png file
